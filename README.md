## EF-Loading Project
   This project demonstrates how to load related entities using Entity Framework Core 
   with multiple connection setups for various databases.

## Features
  1- Entity Loading: Demonstrates eager, lazy, and explicit loading in Entity Framework Core.
  2- Multiple Database Connections: Shows how to configure and manage multiple connection strings
   to different databases in a .NET project.

## Usage
   This project demonstrates loading related data using different approaches in Entity Framework:
